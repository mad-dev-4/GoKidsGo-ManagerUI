# GoKidsGo - Management Application  

Provided by **Marco Deluca** with no affiliation to my employer.  


This repository is a standalone repo focused on a Progressive Web App (PWA) for the management of GoKidsGo.ca.  The intended usage is through a Web browser.  Server side components are not exposed due to security reasons, however the frontend is public to showcase and provide others with an Ionic 6 + Angular example. 

I have worked on and built enterprise software applications for years in various languages.  Typically enterprise applications are not globally available for others to see.  Most of what you find on the internet is a small snippet of code with little context.  

I am providing this example as educational material to showcase an end-to-end application utilizing various web  components for a business user application.  The application is relatively simple but provides a complete user experience.  

## What you can find   
In this package you will find examples of the following:   
* An angular business management application using **Ionic 6**   
* Most Ionic 6 components are used in various ways  
* A Single Page WebApp (SPA) using OAuth and JWT's for stateless servers (no session affinity)   
* Ionic used to build search forms, search lists (with paging) and detail editing screens  
* Image management including upload, cropping and sequencing  
* Recursive Custom Angular components with input data and output events 
* Category tree management components.  Moreover, we use hierarchical tree management with lazy load   
* Simple cache management 
* Dependency injection, observables and promises 
* Angular pipes to help with currency, number and date formatting.  Pipes to sort lists and a pipe to transform a map to iterable  
* Angular environment files 
* Custom logging, page helpers and http interceptors  

## Who is permitted to use 
* Anyone not employed by a large software firm 
* Anyone not in competition with GoKidsGo.ca  
* Anyone in accordance to the license terms  

## Fees  
* No fees are charged if in accordance with the above section.  A simple 'Like' or comment will suffice
